### Description
Hired.CodeFellows is a solution to resume bias, partnering qualified candidates with recruiters. In an effort to meet the needs of a growing tech marketplace requiring new talent, perspective, ideas and diversity we have created a 'blind' unbiased resume source. Here candidates can provide raw data to be evaluated upon in a randomized fashion without many of the naturally occurring biases present in a traditional resume.
